A growing portfolio showcasing my projects in electronics, robotics, embedded systems, PCB design and industrial automation

# 🚀 Engineering Portfolio – Lucía Martínez

Welcome to my personal engineering portfolio!  
This repository is where I document and showcase my work in **electronics, robotics, IoT, embedded systems, and PCB design**.

🛠️ Here you’ll find:
- Real-world projects in robotics and automation  
- Custom PCB designs (2–4 layers)  
- IoT systems with hardware–software integration  
- Prototypes, experiments, and product-oriented development  

⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
This portfolio is currently under construction.  
I’m actively updating it with detailed documentation, images, schematics, and code from my projects.

👉 Check back soon — new projects and improvements will be added regularly!
